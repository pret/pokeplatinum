# Bugs and Glitches

These are known bugs and glitches in the original Pokémon Platinum game: code that
clearly does not work as intended or that only works in limited circumstances
but has the possibility to fail or crash.

Fixes are written in the `diff` format. If you've used Git before, this should
look familiar:

```diff
this is some code
- delete red - lines
+ add green + lines
```

## Battle Engine

### Acid Rain

"Acid Rain" is the colloquial name of an in-battle glitch in Pokémon Platinum,
Heart Gold, and Soul Silver which results in the simultaneous occurrence of
multiple forms of field effects, including multiple instances of weather-based
damage and end-of-turn Ability effects. It is triggered under the following conditions:

1. One or more of any weather effect (aside from heavy rain), Trick Room, Gravity,
or Uproar is in effect.
2. The host player of the battle (or, for in-game battles, the player) uses Pursuit.
3. The target of Pursuit is attempting to switch out on that turn and faints.

<details>
  <summary>Detailed Technical Description</summary>

  The root cause of this bug is a parameter swap in the vanilla bytecode script
  for Pursuit which subtracts the fainted battler's ID from the field conditions
  bitmask, rather than setting the fainted battler variable to that ID.

  To illustrate, suppose that the field condition is set to permanent Hail due
  to a previous activation of Snow Warning. This is represented in the field-condition
  bitmask as `0x80`. At a point after this, our opponent is fainted by Pursuit while
  attempting to switch out, setting `BTLVAR_SCRIPT_TEMP` to `1`. Then, the following
  line of the bytecode is executed:

  ```
- UpdateVarFromVar OPCODE_SUB_TO_ZERO, BTLVAR_FIELD_CONDITIONS, BTLVAR_SCRIPT_TEMP
 ````

  This instruction subtracts the value of `BTLVAR_SCRIPT_TEMP` (1) from the value
  of `BTLVAR_FIELD_CONDITIONS` (`0x80`) and stores the result (`0x7F`) back into
  `BTLVAR_FIELD_CONDITIONS`. This value represents the 7 least-significant bits
  being flipped to `1`, which denotes in-game that all of the following weathers
  are active:

  1. Hail (temporary)
  2. Sun (temporary and permanent)
  3. Sand (temporary and permanent)
  4. Rain (temporary and permanent)

  Because the turn counter for temporary weather was never initialized, temporary
  weather states are functionally permanent. The visible result is that each of
  these weather states is active at once and that all effects related to them also
  trigger.

**Fix:** Edit [`res/battle/res/scripts/subscript_pursuit.s`](https://github.com/pret/pokeplatinum/blob/main/res/battle/scripts/subscripts/subscript_pursuit.s)

### Fire Fang Always Bypasses Wonder Guard

The routine `MoveIsOnDamagingTurn` in `src/battle/battle_lib.c` is used only
by checks related to the ability Wonder Guard. The purpose of this routine
in isolation is to determine if a two-stage move is on its damaging turn;
functionally, this permits the execution of such moves while a Pokémon with
Wonder Guard is on the field, even if the second turn would deal no damage.

The effect for Fire Fang -- which is off-by-one from the effect for Shadow
Force -- was mistakenly included in this routine.

**Fix:** Edit the routine `MoveIsOnDamagingTurn` in [`src/battle/battle_lib.c`](https://github.com/pret/pokeplatinum/blob/main/src/battle/battle_lib.c#L7590):

```diff
static BOOL MoveIsOnDamagingTurn(BattleContext *battleCtx, int move)
{
    switch (MOVE_DATA(move).effect) {
    case BATTLE_EFFECT_BIDE:
    case BATTLE_EFFECT_CHARGE_TURN_HIGH_CRIT:
    case BATTLE_EFFECT_CHARGE_TURN_HIGH_CRIT_FLINCH:
    case BATTLE_EFFECT_CHARGE_TURN_DEF_UP:
    case BATTLE_EFFECT_SKIP_CHARGE_TURN_IN_SUN:
    case BATTLE_EFFECT_FLY:
    case BATTLE_EFFECT_DIVE:
    case BATTLE_EFFECT_DIG:
    case BATTLE_EFFECT_BOUNCE:
-    case BATTLE_EFFECT_FLINCH_BURN_HIT: // BUG: Fire Fang Always Bypasses Wonder Guard (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
+    case BATTLE_EFFECT_SHADOW_FORCE:
        return battleCtx->battleStatusMask & SYSCTL_LAST_OF_MULTI_TURN;
        break;
    }

    return TRUE;
}
```

### Post-KO Switch-In AI Scoring Overflow

During score-evaluation for party members to replace a fainted Pokémon, the
trainer AI can generate scores sufficiently high that will exceed the upper
bound of its scoring memory. This results in incorrect party members being
chosen as replacement battlers.

This bug can apply in each stage of score-evaluation; it is most notable in
its evaluation of stage 1, where the AI will treat a quad-effective match-up --
for example, a Machamp (Fighting+Fighting) vs. a Bastiodon (Rock+Steel) --
as having a score equivalent to 65 rather than 320.

**Fix:** Edit the routine `BattleAI_PostKOSwitchIn` in [`src/battle/battle_lib.c`](https://github.com/pret/pokeplatinum/blob/05aee2e69edd4774823920cec395e29320036f26/src/battle/battle_lib.c#L7925):

```diff
-    u8 score, maxScore;
+    u32 score, maxScore;
```

## Wild Encounters
### Fishing Encounters ignore Sticky Hold and Suction Cups

When calculating the encounter rate for fishing encounters the abilities Sticky 
Hold and Suction Cups are supposed to double the encounter rate. However, due to
a typo, the encounter rate stays unmodified.

**Fix:** Edit the routine `ModifyEncounterRateWithFieldParams` in [`src/overlay006/wild_encounters.c`](https://github.com/pret/pokeplatinum/blob/4fb8a8f567ebbfc99a1d7f2e5f1e8edd9beb4aa7/src/overlay006/ov6_02240C9C.c#L1390)

```diff
-                v0 * 2; // BUG: Abilities do not Increase Fishing Encounter Rate (see docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)
+                v0 *= 2;
```

### Surfing and Fishing Encounters ignore Magnet Pull

When generating a wild encounter, the abilities Magnet Pull and Static  
attempt to force the encountered mon to be respectively Steel or Electric type by
manipulating the chosen encounter slot. Land encounters properly check each ability in turn,
but surf and fishing encounters will overwrite Magnet Pull's forced encounter slot with a random one
due to lacking a check in between Magnet Pull and Static.

```diff
  v0 = TryGetSlotForTypeMatchAbility(firstPartyMon, encounterFieldParams, encounterTable, MAX_WATER_ENCOUNTERS, TYPE_STEEL, ABILITY_MAGNET_PULL, &encounterSlot);
-  v0 = TryGetSlotForTypeMatchAbility(firstPartyMon, encounterFieldParams, encounterTable, MAX_WATER_ENCOUNTERS, TYPE_ELECTRIC, ABILITY_STATIC, &encounterSlot);
-
-  if (!v0) {
-      encounterSlot = GetWaterEncounterSlot();
-  }
+  if (!v0)
+  {
+    v0 = TryGetSlotForTypeMatchAbility(firstPartyMon, encounterFieldParams, encounterTable, MAX_WATER_ENCOUNTERS, TYPE_ELECTRIC, ABILITY_STATIC, &encounterSlot);
+    if (!v0) {
+        encounterSlot = GetWaterEncounterSlot();
+    }
+  }
```

## Title Screen
### Giratina Hover Range
The Giratina model on the title screen hovers up and down slowly, but the range of motion is smaller than intended because the hover angle is incorrectly scaled before being passed to `CalcSineDegrees_Wraparound`, which expects degrees as input.

**Fix:** Edit the hover calculation in the function `TitleScreen_Render` in [`src/applications/title_screen.c`](https://github.com/pret/pokeplatinum/blob/main/src/applications/title_screen.c#L656):

```diff
-    fx32 offset = CalcSineDegrees_Wraparound((titleScreen->giratinaHoverAngle * 0xFFFF) / 360);
+    fx32 offset = CalcSineDegrees_Wraparound(titleScreen->giratinaHoverAngle);
```

## 3D Rendering
### Invalid VRAM Manager Type in G3DPipeline_InitEx
When creating a new 3D graphics state using `G3DPipeline_InitEx`, with the `plttVramManagerType` parameter set to `VRAM_MANAGER_TYPE_FRAME`, the system will allocate a second texture VRAM manager instead of the intended palette VRAM manager. This bug never actually occurs in the game as the `plttVramManagerType` parameter is always set to `VRAM_MANAGER_TYPE_LINKED_LIST`, but it is still a bug in the code.

**Fix:** Edit the function `G3DPipeline_InitEx` in [`src/g3d_pipeline_state.c`](https://github.com/pret/pokeplatinum/blob/main/src/g3d_pipeline_state.c#L40):

```diff
- NNS_GfdInitFrmTexVramManager(plttVramSize * PALETTE_VRAM_BLOCK_SIZE, TRUE);
+ NNS_GfdInitFrmPlttVramManager(plttVramSize * PALETTE_VRAM_BLOCK_SIZE, TRUE);
```
